## Receipt Processor
This project is my implementation/solution to the [receipt-processor-challenge](https://github.com/fetch-rewards/receipt-processor-challenge) by Fetch.
I am not applying for a job position there because I don't live in the United States and am therefore don't fulfill their requirements. I found this challenge in this absolutely hilarious [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1dtvolz/comment/lbcbcc2/), where some guy gets rejected from a job because he failed this challenge miserably and blames everyone else :rofl: I then decided to spend a couple of hours to do the challenge myself.

```
git clone https://github.com/juliuswaldmann/receipt-processor-challenge.git
